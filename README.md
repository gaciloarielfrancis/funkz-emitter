# funkz-emitter
Allowing parts of your application to communicate asynchronously without being tightly coupled.
A lightweight and dependency-free **Event Emitter** written entirely in **TypeScript**.  
It provides a simple, type-safe way to **emit**, **listen**, and **unsubscribe** from custom events â€” perfect for **game systems**, **frontend apps**, and **ECS architectures**.

funkz-emitter is a lightweight and framework-agnostic event management library written in TypeScript. It is designed to work seamlessly across **all TypeScript-based frameworks and environments**, including **React, Angular, Vue, Node.js**, and **game engines** or **custom applications** that rely on event-driven architectures.

Unlike framework-specific solutions, funkz-emitter does not depend on any external libraries or runtime environments. Its minimal and strongly typed design allows developers to easily integrate it into any TypeScript projectâ€”whether it runs in the **browser**, **server**, or **embedded environment**â€”without additional setup or compatibility issues.

Because itâ€™s built purely in TypeScript, funkz-emitter takes full advantage of **type inference**, **generics**, and **intellisense support**, ensuring a clean and predictable developer experience. It helps you implement clear communication between components, modules, or systems using the familiar pattern of **emitters and listeners**, making your codebase more modular and maintainable.

In short, funkz-emitter serves as a **universal event communication layer** that simplifies event handling for any TypeScript-powered application, regardless of its framework or runtime.

## Features

- âš¡ Built **100% in TypeScript** â€” no Node.js `events` module required  
- âœ… Strongly typed â€” event names and payloads are type-checked  
- ðŸ§  Follows the **Observer / Pub-Sub** design pattern  
- ðŸ’¡ Minimal, clean, and framework-agnostic  
- ðŸ•¹ Perfect for game engine and ECS logic

## Installation

```bash
npm i funkz-emitter
```

---

## Usage

```ts
import EventEmitter from "funkz-emitter";

// Initialize the emitter
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Example data type
interface IntervalData {
    message: string;
    duration: number;
}

// Listening for an event
emitter.on<IntervalData>("interval", (data) => {
    console.log(`[on] Interval event triggered:`, data.message, "in", data.duration, "ms");
});

// Listening once (auto removed after first trigger)
emitter.once<IntervalData>("interval", (data) => {
    console.log(`[once] This will only appear once:`, data.message);
});

setInterval(() => {
    // Emitting an event with data
    emitter.emit<IntervalData>("interval", {
        message: "Operation took too long.",
        duration: 3000,
    });
}, 3000);

// Attaching multiple listeners with identifiers
emitter.on("update", () => console.log("[A] update received"), "A");
emitter.on("update", () => console.log("[B] update received"), "B");

// Emitting the event triggers both listeners
emitter.emit("update");

// Emitting again triggers only listener B
emitter.emit("update", null, "B");

// Remove only listener with identifier "A"
emitter.off("update", "A");

// Emitting with custom type data
emitter.on<number>("progress", (data) => {
    console.log("Progress:", data, "%");
});
emitter.emit<number>("progress", 75);

```
### How It Works
- The emitter acts as a message hub.
- You can register listeners for specific event names (on, once).
- Later, when you emit that event name (emit), all matching listeners get called.
- You can remove listeners when theyâ€™re no longer needed (off).

## Using Global Emit â€” No Instance Required
This example shows how to emit events globally without the need to declare or reference an emitter variable. Perfect for shared, application-wide event handling.

```ts
// main.ts

import { on, once } from "funkz-emitter";

// Persistent listener
on<string>("user:login", (username) => {
    console.log(`[Main] User logged in: ${username}`);
});

// One-time listener
once<string>("system:init", (version) => {
    console.log(`[Main] System initialized. Version: ${version}`);
});

```

```ts
// pageA.ts

import { emit } from "funkz-emitter";

function loginUser() {
    emit("user:login", "Funkz");
}

function initializeSystem() {
    emit("system:init", "1.0.0");
}

// Trigger global events
loginUser();
initializeSystem();

```

```ts
// pageB.ts

import { on, off } from "funkz-emitter";

// Listen globally for user logins
on<string>("user:login", (username) => {
    console.log(`[PageB] Detected login: ${username}`);
});

// Optionally remove listener later
setTimeout(() => {
    off("user:login");
    console.log("[PageB] Stopped listening for user:login");
}, 5000);

```
### How It Works
- All pages import from "funkz-emitter", which uses a shared singleton emitter internally.
- Any call to emit() in one page automatically triggers listeners in another.
- Works even when modules are dynamically loaded â€” no need to pass instances around.
